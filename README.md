# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project reviews the historical data of how different Kickstarter campaigns have behaved. The objective of this revision is to establish the  best way forward for a play crowdfunding project in the US according to the retrospective data insights. 

### Purpose
The client Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play *Fever*, therefore, the results and conclusions obtained from this assessment aim to set up her campaign for success.

## Analysis and Challenges
In order to analyze the Kickstarter data it was necessary to transform timestamp dates into a working Excel date for both campaign start and end dates. 
To have an initial sense of the data a series of pivot tables and graphs were obtained. 
* To do so it was important to review the data type for the cells, since the initial file had various formats and when using Excel formulas the final value might not be in the appropriate cell type.
* Another important aspect was to separate the data into secondary sheets in order to further analyze data subgroups, for example, successful US campaigns vs failed US campaigns and therefore, determine this key differentiators.
